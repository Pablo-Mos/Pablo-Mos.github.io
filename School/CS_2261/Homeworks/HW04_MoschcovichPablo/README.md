## Controls:

- Move player on game screen with arrow keys

## Objective:
- Eliminate all evil fish by hitting them with bullets
- Once there are no evil fish left, go to the shore (left side) to win
- Contact with any evil fish will result in losing the game
- Evil fish increase in size when one of them is eliminated
        
*bug: if evil fish increment in size when close enough to edge of screen, they'll 'get stuck' and just bounce along one axis (similar to issue seen with pineapples in a recent lab that could not be fixed)
